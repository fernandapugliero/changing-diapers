    <h1>Best Places to Change Diapers in Berlin</h1>
    <h2>Your ultimate guide to diaper-changing stations in the city</h2>
    <p class="post-date">Published on: July 2025</p>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>We've explored Berlin to find the best spots for changing diapers — and we've ranked our top 10. From cafes to cultural centers, this list includes places that were tested, loved, and submitted by real parents. The ranking may change as new places are added, so check back often. And if you know a great spot, <a href="../submit">add it here</a>!</p>

      <h3>10. Erchy's</h3>
      <img src="../images/erchys.jpg" alt="Erchy's Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>A warm, relaxed café where the staff welcomes kids and strollers without a blink. The changing table is clean and easy to access — and the coffee is great, too.</p>

      <h3>9. Luuv Café</h3>
      <img src="../images/luuv.jpg" alt="Luuv Café Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>This lovely spot near Ostkreuz is full of baby-friendly touches: play areas, high chairs, and a spotless changing station tucked in the back. Perfect for a midday break with your little one.</p>

      <h3>8. SmartKids</h3>
      <img src="../images/smartkids.jpg" alt="SmartKids Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>Not just a café, but a full play cafe concept designed for babies and toddlers. The changing setup here is solid — clean, functional, and located near the action.</p>

      <h3>7. Le Belfort</h3>
      <img src="../images/lebelfort.jpg" alt="Le Belfort Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>A quieter café in Prenzlauer Berg where you’ll find both good food and a surprisingly thoughtful changing station. A hidden gem for parents in the area.</p>

      <h3>6. Kulturhaus Insel Berlin</h3>
      <img src="../images/insel.jpg" alt="Kulturhaus Insel Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>A biergarten located on a small island in the heart of Berlin. The changing station is inside the women’s restroom and usually very clean and well maintained. The fold-down table can be operated with one hand — because your baby is probably in the other.</p>

      <h3>5. BRLO</h3>
      <img src="../images/brlo.jpg" alt="BRLO Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>This brewery in Gleisdreieck is surprisingly kid-friendly. The changing station is located on the ground floor in the accessible restroom. It’s clean, stroller-accessible, and even better — there’s a sandpit outside for the kids to play while you enjoy a beer (or try to).</p>

      <h3>4. Mignon Sicilian Bakery</h3>
      <img src="../images/mignon.jpg" alt="Mignon Sicilian Bakery Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>Delicious Sicilian pastries, friendly staff, and a surprisingly well-equipped changing table in the restroom. A sweet spot to rest and refresh with your little one.</p>

      <h3>3. MaraLou Café</h3>
      <img src="../images/maralou.jpg" alt="MaraLou Café Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>A cozy neighborhood café with excellent coffee, plenty of space for strollers, a clean and accessible changing table, and warm service. MaraLou is truly baby- and parent-friendly.</p>

      <h3>2. Kap Frida</h3>
      <img src="../images/kapfrida.jpg" alt="Kap Frida Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>Small, cozy and truly baby-friendly, Kap Frida offers toys, a lowered sink, a clean changing station, and excellent food. Located on the Stralau peninsula, it’s a great stop during a sunny walk by the water.</p>

      <h3>1. dm</h3>
      <img src="../images/dm.jpg" alt="dm Berlin" class="post-image">
      <p>The beloved go-to for many parents in Germany. With over [NUMERO] locations across the country, most dm stores offer a well-equipped diaper changing station. You’ll typically find a changing pad, disposable covers, wipes, hand sanitizer, and even free diapers in various sizes. The only downside? Stores are closed on Sundays and public holidays. Always check online to make sure your local branch has a changing table before heading out.</p>
